  <h3><center>About Crush Brewing</center></h3>
  <p><center>
        Crush Brewing was founded by four co-workers/friends/family. We chose the name “Crush Brewing” as a double meaning, 
        the first has to do with the brewing process itself where the first step is to crush the whole grain malt with a mill. 
        The second meaning is to have an intense attraction, which is what we hope our customers will feel for us.
      </center></p>
        <p><center>
        With a Pennsylvania G Brewing license, we manufacture and sell our beer on and off premise. We have a 
        10-barrel brew house with 3 fermenters and plan to brew 2 days per week for the first year (with four weeks off) for a total of 960 barrels. 
      </center></p>
